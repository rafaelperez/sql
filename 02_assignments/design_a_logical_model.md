# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Withholding previous records can raise privacy concerns, depending on the relevant regulatory laws. These laws may require disclosing to the user what information is being stored and maybe would require extra engineering work, like anonymizing historical data.

Additionally, if there is a data breach that reveals private information, it could further expose the company to legal and PR damages.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
It becomes clear that a comprehensive business schema is highly complex. Despite the numerous additional business processes that the AdventureWorks schema can accommodate, even for a small bookstore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate and conduct extensive research to ensure that important steps or information are properly represented with the implemented tables.

In my design, I noticed the absence of crucial tables, such as those related to shipping and handling, transaction history, and insufficient tables for product details and reviews. Additionally, a more detailed schema for storing customer data is needed.
